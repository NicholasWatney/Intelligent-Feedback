66,congrats on your new puppy ben as a roman catholic i completely agree with what you have said about pope benedict and the importance of his teachings happy 2023 to you and yours from hungary
36,i dont ever donate cash to organizations because who knows where that money goes not to mention the huge salaries the administrators take i choose to donate things such as canned food because it has little chance of being used for wrong
31,the backlash is ahead as a correction offered precisely because weve collectively allowed good to be called evil and evil promoted as good weve not merely failed in our duty were ignoring that we actually have a duty which is required of us keep on keepin on ben god bless you and your family
26,you and andrew tate should sit down and have a sunday special i think in a calm room with people not attacking him he has a lot of great things to say him and his brother are actually really great people he would be more likely to have a sophisticated conversation if people were coming at him with blatant accusations and untruths
24,the young have always been rebelling against society and parents traditions but the problem now is these young ones never actually grow up leaving university to continue their destructive toxic nature into work society and their own young families to them the only agenda that matters is the exact opposite to the status quo no matter the certain damage and devastation caused
18,congrats on the new puppy and the new baby ben
17,as a romanian the fact that ben can say romania is amazing 
16,even when bens speaking slowly it still sounds fast
14,thank you ben you are exactly right about andrew tate and his popularity im in my teens and have many friends who love tate i worry for them because i know many of his diagnoses are correct but few of his prescriptions are i try to help them as much as i can
14,2 things can be true at once you can care and worry about the environment you can not be a crazy person like most of these people
14,cant wait to see bens opinion on tate
13,thank you ben have been pointing this out for decades and its absolutely heartwretchingheartbreaking to witness whats occurring archbishop vigano is similar to papa benedict xvi in love for truth and a passion for souls to accept and live in the light of truth all of the evil crapola going on is because of removing god from every aspect of our lives thanks again ben god bless you and your family
13,is ben finally gonna mention andrew tate watch him join the daily wire next year
12,ben happy new year am excited for all your shows in this new year
11,thank god ben matt and candace are back happy new year
11,jesus christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day praying for everyone everyday god bless you all 
10,christians dont hate change it depends on what the changes are changes that are not good destroying the human language for made up pronouns destroying our economy for green points and destroying our sovereignty by opening the border
10,i wish hamlin a safe and effective recovery thanks jim eagle
7,this year might be more insane than last
6,hey ben great show topg andrew tate was in fact in the same weight division as myself in professional kickboxing light heavyweight cruiserweight for the most part
6,pope tate new york terror attack always when ben goes on holidays so many things happens
6,the thing about andrew tate is that his listeners dont eat up every single thing its that they appreciate he doesnt pull punches it doesnt mean we agree with every single point but hes winning at life hes doing what he wants but he is promoting traditional values for men in there own lives we take the good stuff from him and laugh at the other stuff not everyone wants his exact life we just love that hes a masculine man and doesnt give a shit and honestly its meant to draw fire because the right never fights with fire or fights at all we like that andrew punches and he punches hard and hes quick and hes ready he asks one follow up question just like you ben and anyone he debates back pedals and shuts up i respect the hell out of that
6,why would you not vote for macarthy i dont know maybe because when you hand republicans a soft win they dont change sorry ben i would love to see him lose and maybe see if the party can pull its head out of its ass
6,the fall in the garden was a reliance on self knowledge like we need clothes we are naked we will make our own clothes relying on self not god competing knowledges or moreso relying on our works over our faith in god man does not live by bread alone but every word from the mouth of his creator
6,happy new year brother and everyone else from syracuse ny
6,rip pope benedict xvi thank you for your service to god it will never be forgotten
6,is ben finally gonna mention andrew tate watch him join the daily wire next year
6,urgent emergency please join me in prayer for damar hamlin and family he collapsed during football game in critical condition he desperately need your prayers please pray for him god bless you all
5,i live in colorado and starting this year the government is forcing grocery stores to charge 10 cents per grocery bag government sucks
5,the thing is andrew tate wasnt saying men and women belong to each other he was saying women have emotions ie they arent objects but women belong to the men in their lives ie their fathers or husbands he isnt being conservative hes advocating specifically for the things that most people would say should be left in the past its a little disappointing to see ben dancing around this guy hes a worm who gets way too much attention
5,ancient wisdomwhich is a form of data thank you ben at last somebody said it 
5,id love to see a debate between ben and tate it would be like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object
5,we need every republican voting for good things and against bad things which is far from guaranteed because since when has our party unanimously supported anything

5,love your shows always intelligent
5,andrew tate isnt not remotely trangressive his mindset is completely 16th century
5,its almost like people just dont want to know truth theyre okay being ignorant its strange
5,why are there a bunch of comments here just commenting the same thing about andrew tate bots
5,can i like this about a billion times love this guy total bucher
5,new year same old problems
5,whos ready for another bad year for america
4,i hope you had a lovely holiday congratulations on your new puppy
4,we got to stop voting just for party lines so we can go for the bigger picture sorry ben but we arent voting for rhinos just so democrats lose someday we need stand up for our actual values
4,ben the obvious answer to your question about mccarthy is that he will not say no to joe biden thats why we call them rinos
4,andrew tate fans about to write 10 paragraphs about why he isnt just scamming desperate dudes out of their money
4,the ground we need to stand on is that secularism is a religion we are a religious people and buying into any aspect of neutrality will fail
4,yes any republican should just plant their feet and say no but there is real push back against kevin mccarthy because the party cant depend on him actually say no
4,woke women today are destroying men it is so sad to witness this phenomenon
4,i have problem with the main message that tate is selling what i have an issue with is the nonsense he opens up with to attract people hes a top con artist over a top g to me he isnt saying things that people wont say hell say them in a attention seeking manner to piss you off or to make you think hes speaking nonsense then finish with something that makes sense that is basically common sense but still doesnt actually deal with the nonsense he said in the first place to grab your attention and his audience will look up to him like a messiah for saying basic things kids like to listen to nonsense made sense to a degree plus people like ben saying hes speaking facts is what people need to stop and expose his real agenda because all hes doing is conning young men with entertainment to purchase his products and call him jesus
4,ben has a puppy this year is going to be one for the books
4,thank you for the valuable theological civic discussion on our wellbeing ben
4,happy new yearplease take care and stay safe everyone 
4,two things the left dont understand action and application
4,im concerned about the shear number of non youtube friendly accounts in this comment section 
4,everybody should calm down regarding damar hamlin it just means the shot is working thanks jim eagle
3,been saying essentially this for years when one is young they tend to look at whatever their parents or especially grandparents do and think its simply old fashioned and there is surely a better way they are just stuck in the past they need to get with the times but as one grows up and gets older they quickly realize that there are good reasons they did things the way they did they werent simply old fashioned beliefs without reason they had good reasons they had wisdom and reason in their decisions even those things that are simply tradition have a lot of good in them
3,if we continue to allow poor people to breed we are doomed wow
3,when it was announced that the former pope died all children around the world breathed a sigh of relief if just for a moment
3,ben shapiro is pretty based in regards to his opinion on tate i think tate is a symptom of radical feminism dominating the narrative when you call masculinity toxic long enough men start to feel alienated they then start to look for someone to counter that argument in its most extreme form i like a lot of his dating advice for men i think where he fucks up is acting like just because you are rich morality doesnt apply to you a poor man must be monogamous because he has no choice a woman must be monogamous because its immoral if she isnt but a rich tall athletic man can fuck a new girl every day and its just fine i call bullshit its just as immoral and just because that opportunity arises very easily doesnt make it less moral whether or not hes guilty is irrelevant to the fact that if he wasnt a sexual deviant he probably wouldnt be in this issue the fact that he sleeps around with a new girl every day means he has a new girl who could lie to get him in trouble every day married men who dont cheat rarely have these accusations thrust upon them promiscuous men oftentimes have this issue dave portnoy is another excellent example the dude was doing crazy nasty shit with 18 year old girls and he got exposed for it
3,my question to ben why does he think mccarthy will say no to biden on everything
3,mccarthy wont say no thats why
3,the people oppose mccarthy because we find it likely that he is one of your quality candidates and will do as much to oppose the regime as mcconnells senate just did
3,nothings changed the problem is kevin mccarthy rep bob good rva kevin mccarthy is the right guy to lead this conference the right guy to be speaker of the house rep dusty johnson rsd
3,they say religion is out of datethe first name god gives to moses to tell the people is i am how can the eternal present ever be out of date the biblical thinkers are not behind us today they are way ahead of us
3,thank you for always being willing to speak the truth hope you had a happy hanukkah as well
3,happy new year ben good episode
3,serious question has anyone ever seen lobotomies taught in a history textbook it should be in his farewell speech dwight d eisenhower not only discussed the military industrial complex but scientism the topic can be easily woven into high school curriculum
3,tate is top g bro so watch your attitude
3,excess deaths wasnt a thing until mr na showed up
3,ben you might want to do deeper research on pope benedict he had a lot of flaws
3,the weird paganism and narcissism that ben mentions are the core difference between the woke and those still grounded in reality those in the latter category believe that reality can only be changed when reality is first understood as it is and then changed with methods that correspond to that understanding the former believe that reality is not something outside of any one persons perception but a matter of mind which the selfcongratulatory anointed can change by willing the change literally that is what they believe it is also that occult belief that is uncannily behind many of the historic movements with deadly results it would be unbelievable if those who subscribe to that set of beliefs didnt explicitly say so but they do in their books and on their websites it can all be heard straight from the horses mouth just as plainly as paul ehrlich plainly said that mass death was the alternative to mass sterilization
3,congrats on the puppy ben
3,do you think 2023 will be better than 2022
3,christianity is just as nonsensical as wokism
3,this comment wont get more than 10 likes
2,i want jim jordan as house speaker
2,im 24 and had no idea who andrew tate was til ben and candace shed light on him last year still really dont know what he does happy new year conservatives 
2,its not rocket science why my generation gen z is so depressed you cant uproot 2000 years of tradition and culture and throw us into a dystopia si fi world where we can do whatever the hell we want personally i wish i grew up in another country like korea japan eastern europe taiwan brazil or hell even russia because id rather be a slave following godly orders and love my heritage religion tradition and community rather than be liberated and free as i am now in godless la
2,i have mixed feelings and i listened for some 15 minutes i am all for traditions however the truth ben is pushing is the truth of faith ifwhen this truth is in conflict with historical reality i have a problem actually i can see many problems unlike ben i am europeanborn unlike bens my alma mater is medieval and i was interested in the history of universities yes they were founded by christianity but they were much less charming places than ben imagines i didnt follow pope benedict closely but i do know that he pushed for the beatification of pius xii our californian ben doesnt seem to have a problem with this fact and the tradition behind it but i do we have a serious problem with at least one generation but its idiotization was caused for a number of factors including the fact that parents worked for the bezos 60 hours a week and had no time for kids and the fact that those who created our totally artificial reality including autistic geniuses were applauded and stimulated as saviors more innovation huh more domination huh more aggression huh etc i didnt hear the rights appeals to slow down yes there is a tradition smell the roses yes there is a tradition etc clearly ben can read i hope that one day he discovers the history and finds joy in reading it
2,30 bugattis 
2,yasher koach excellent show mr shapiro
2,i have a son and a daughter that i home school i promise to try to teach them the real truth im not sure i was but i promise to try
2,the cops had been investigating tate long before he got into it with greta the idea of a conspiracy against him because of his internet fame sounds silly to me he simply got caught up
2,best throw away line of the episode was did he actually fight corn pop
2,im moving to conservative philippines
2,why does ben love mccarthy so much
2,romania is a member state of the eu the special police force arresting those celebrities are not corupt in romania many women are traficked the uk police was trying to find the location of thes3 vips what deconspired their location was the pizza company appearing in some pics theyve posted online these are few facts
2,this is the year to it be sided but perseverance
2,if matt walsh was truly a good man he would let ben borrow at least a little bit of his voice holy cow ben please start screaming for 1hr straight before every show
2,could say the same about ben somethings that ben says are good and some things are really not good but will ben get cancelled 
2,i could be completely wrong but i predict 2023 is going to be a filler year things wont become interesting until 2024
2,whats with the bots in the comments section daily wire will never pick up tate if they know what good business is
2,the bots have already taken over i see im really hoping to see much less of them in 2023
2,jesus christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day praying for everyone everyday god bless you all

1,lets see jbs tax records
1,hey ben love your content would love time stamps on your talking points on these videos if possible
1,incredible episode in fact its too good to be just an episode i believe ben just reveled the major problem in the west right now i keep saying there is a reason we do things this way because the culture is to reject all ancient wisdom there is a reason that god devoted an entire book to wisdom the book of proverbs because humans have a tendency to move the ancient boundary stones for political and cultural expedience
1,i doubt andrew tate has critically looked at the bible when it comes to marriage or anything
1,pope benidict ignored and covered up the truth of child abuse in the church
1,were simply living during the time of the fall of the roman empire
1,loved the show today you started off 2023 in style keep it up
1,i appreciate bens perspective on many things the problem though is ben too is no prophet and is wrong alot heads up there is unprecedented climate events happening at greater frequency many catostrophic tipping points also why is bens ideology for population explosion right and others wrong what planet supports 20billion 50billion unbelievsble the ignorance
1,i think andrew tate is an image of what jesus means when he says all who come in by other ways are thieves and robbers whatever your belief about jesus is the thought being expressed is that just because you can say true things or construct a kind of morality outside the church synagogue etc it is a false stolen parody of truth and does not bring redemption unless that truth emerges from and within the incarnation of the divine
1,is it true that biden just made it were children can have trans surgery and there is nothing the parents can do legally
1,yeah but you were super duper wrong about the midterms soooo
1,the holy spirit is the spirit of truth when you oppose the truth you oppose the very essence of god
1,ask any 10 year old what a hormone is
1,the problem with marriage today in the us is the man has all the responsibility and none of the authority the woman can divorce you for any reason so you better do as she says which makes her resent you more take the government out of marriage and responsible men will get married
1,one saint and two sinners on your thumbnail
1,i dont think that tate is arguing in favor for gen 
1,this is going to be a good year
1,eric adams honestly doesnt strike me as a very intelligent human being
1,andrew tates voice is so annoying
1,republicans have always been wishy washy lazy clowns im not expecting much from them they are cowards that dont fight for their constituents of course that is better than the insanity of the left but gop does not fight it
1,once again ben is a numbers guy not a strategy guy it matters who the speaker is because if you have a milk toast like km then it shows the base they are not serious about issues like transing the kids or investigating pos biden
1,well said
1,happy new year ben shapiro hope you enjoyed your holiday time with your family 
1,i kind of think the last pope was part of the problem he could have issued official statements to the effect of just to clear up everyones confusion catholicism and christianity does not support homosexuality or transgenderism catholicism and christianity does not condone abortion period why didnt he ever say anything like if you support those things you are not catholic or christian im looking at you former vice president joe biden something like that
1,what if the nevermccarthyrepublicans cast their votes for a conservative democrat like jared golden out of spite for mccarthy
1,politicians are looking more and more like children so petty
1,he was wrong about all this but he has gotten his way low birth rates and increased death rates
1,thanks for the show ben daily wire team
1,when people have been consistently wrong following their advice is a stupid b self destructive c progressive policy d all the above

0,tate x ben debate
0,i wish i could talk to tate about what he says at the 35ish min mark about the bible saying the father of the bride gives her to the man if hes just citing records of cultures around the world and really doesnt care about whats right good or god wants then theres nothing more to say but if he or anyone is implying by his reference to the bible as being all one needs to know about biblical doctrine all the truths about marriage manhood womanhood parenting etc then theyre way off god god is the 1st one to say anything about marriage at all and what he said regarding parents and the leaving of them and entering of marriage actually only referenced the man and his parents obviously the rest of the bible upholds the understanding that the manhusband is in a unique role in society and the marriage and family as being created 1st and being the head of his wife leader and most responsible for the 2 of them as a unit before god and above their children that in a fallen world among corrupted mankind women in particular needed protection and the ungodly cultures in particular didnt recognize their equality as adults in their society or members of mankind with asst rights so understandably they were to be protected by the father in particular and a man would have to ask that father for permission to take his daughter away and enter into marriage with her but i dont think anywhere in the bible old or new testament states that as a command for the most part it is mostly just recording the cultures and customs of the peoples of those places and times and god didnt focus on changing every last little thing about them when they converted but focused on things of eternal and spiritual importance and encouraged and even commanded things which would bring about the rest of anything needed naturally as one did those things things like reading gods word throughout the day and work and travel and home time withto you kids of loving trusting and fearing god above all things all of the ten commandments plus love your neighbor as yourself covers basically everything of seeking after wisdom of applying it and ones parents teachings not paying lip service only to god and on and on proverbs mentions how to treat ones mother many times and no man who honors his mother and god will dishonor or mistreat his wife and daughters the way god commanded the kings to not multiply wives unto themselves vrs what other nations taught or embraced sadly and with tragic results this was disobeyed not that anyone else should have multiple wives or husbands or adultery or fornication the account in creation and other things said made it clear god have never ordained thatthose never okayed it he dealt with deals with each of his people and israel at large according to his plan and purpose knowledge and wisdom tate should be ashamed of even bringing the bible into it if he doesnt care about gods word or will and apart from seeking god and his word theres no point in discussing morality or truth either

0,thank you ben for raising for ukrainians 3
0,ben is such a hack its frightening how are you going to talk about pope benedict and sidestep the fact hes incredibly unliked not because of his traditional views but the fact he protected countless pedophiles from justice and hoarded cash then he moves into a tirade against social media which while i agree with him he advertises his brand on every one of those platforms put your money where your mouth is benny

0, he was a kickboxing champion in light cruiserweight 1865 lbs and lightheavyweight 200 lbs classes not lightweight
0,they want american constitution representative in that position i hope they figure it out
0,i dont know if ben or his staff read the comments but expanding upon the wisdom of pope benedict would have been really helpful im not a christian i dont have the awareness of what his messages or the truth is so the first 30 minutes of the episode really made no sense in effect you were arguing against the narcissistic social media culture which is agreeable but then failing to actually explain what the solution to that is
0,i missed listening to your podcast ben thank you
